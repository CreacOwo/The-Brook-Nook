# The Rules

This is a file documenting the rules that can be found in the hangout. Breaking these rules may result in actions being taken on your account. You must also follow Roblox's rules.

## Possible sanctions ðŸ”¨ :
If a moderator deems that you have broken a rule, they may result in one of these solutions:
1. Muting you in-game.
2. Kicking you with a message if needed.
3. Banning you for a pre-determined amount of time.
4. Permanently banning you from the game.

## Game-breaking ðŸŽ¯ :
Anything that might interfere with experience in a way it wasn't intended to. This includes:
1. Exploiting of any kind.
2. Intentional disruption of in-game events or activities.
3. Sharing or promoting game-breaking glitches or bugs without reporting them.
4. Intentional server disruption or attempts to crash the game.

## Outfits ðŸ‘” :
We do not allow outfits that may cause controversy. This includes:
1. Avatars that reference historic wars.
2. Avatars that reference known characters which are frowned upon.
3. Avatars that are disruptive such as giant avatars or avatars that may cause epilepsy.

## Behaviour ðŸ¦¦ :
If a moderator deems that your behavior is unacceptable, it may be because of these factors:
1. Drama, insulting other people, or what might come off as a fight.
2. Any public display of affection that might make others uncomfortable.
3. Any inappropriate topics or actions.
4. Arguing with moderators (to a certain extent).
5. Spamming, "barking", anything that might come off as troll behavior.

If a rule is not listed here, it doesn't mean it's not bannable. At the end of the day, moderators will use common sense, and so should you.
